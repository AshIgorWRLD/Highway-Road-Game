# Highway-Road-Game
Desktop Java racing game, made using "Swing", main point of the game is drive as much as you can

Game got 3 modes: 

DESKTOP MODE: you just play game with the bot that spams enemy cars for you

ONLINE DRIVE MODE: desktop game, but your enemies can be generated by another player "spammer", if he disconnect, you will play then against the bot

ONLINE SPAM MODE: you can spam different cars on different lines to player-driver

GAME MANAGMENT AND KEYS: for player driver: 'W' - move up, 'A' - move left, 'S' - move down, 'D' - move right, 'SPACE' - gas, 'P' - brake; for player spammer: 'W' - switch lane up, 'S' - switch lane down, 'A' - switch car left, 'D' - switch car right, 'SPACE' - spam car

ADDITIONAL INFO: it is my first serious project, so here is quite bad MVC realisation, what is more server uses thread pool that was made by scratch by me and so it is far from perfect working one
